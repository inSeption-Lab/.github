# Inseption lab <br> (IN Silico research for Estimating Patient’s Tumor evoluTION)
## About us
INSEPTION group adopts the Systems Biology strategy to improve understanding of cancer complexity and increase predictive power with personalized clinical relevance, combining novel biological experiments, imaging techniques and advanced in silico methods. The INSEPTION group argues that cancer can only be deeply understood and cured through the collaboration among scientists from different disciplines that could potentially bridge the gap between basic science and the clinic.

## Focus
INSEPTION group focuses on hallmarks of tumor evolution including:
- the increased cellular proliferative capacity,
- the invasive mechanisms that cancer cells adopt, varying from single cell migration to collective strategies,
- the metabolic reprogramming,
- the extensive genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity, and
- the formation of new vasculature and remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM).

Tumors are not growing in isolation. The tumor microenvironment plays a significant role in regulating dynamically the invasive and proliferative capacities of cells. Both irregular vascularization and matrix stiffness have been observed in tumor microenvironment to affect tumor progression, invasion, drug delivery, drug resistance and metastasis. On the other hand, the metabolic alterations of cancer cells have also a dramatic effect on the extracellular microenvironment, generating a dynamic feedback between the cells and their microenvironment. The investigation of cell-to-cell, cell-to-matrix and cell-drug interactions at several levels and scales of complexity, comprise the main focus of exploration in our work.
